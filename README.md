"## My first repository. To use this analysis code, simply run the R script in terminal or in RStudio. You will need the packages tidyverse, kableExtra, and here. Here will automatically direct the csv read function to the correct file. The bash code needed to run this script is the following: Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('Analysis_Report.rmd')". Good luck running everything, and if you run into any problems, email me at pahongle@gmail.com!"
