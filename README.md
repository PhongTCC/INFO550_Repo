"To use this analysis code, simply run the R script in terminal or in RStudio. You will need the packages tidyverse and kableExtra. All scripts needed to make the report are in the R folder. Figures will be populated in the figures folder. Raw data is in the raw_data folder and cleaned data will end up in the data folder. To make the report, simply type in make after navigating to this folder. You can also type in "make report". Make install will install the necessary libraries. HOWEVER, SOME PCs don't give you permission to install this way. The only package you need is tidyverse, so you may need to install it manually despite there being a rule to install. Lastly, there is a rule "make help". Type this in to get some helpful documentation regarding the make ful. ***WARNING*** Please note that I am doing this on a Windows machine. Therefore, you may have to change some things to make this work on another machine such as changing the paths symbols (//data instead of /data). If there are any difficulties using my scripts, please email me at pahongle@gmail.com. A video of me running this with instructions is also attached to prove it works!"
